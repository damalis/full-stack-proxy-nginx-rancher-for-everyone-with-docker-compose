chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Requirements

Make sure you have the latest versions of **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine.

## Manual

### Configuration
				 
download with
```
git clone https://github.com/damalis/full-stack-proxy-nginx-rancher-for-everyone-with-docker-compose.git
```

Open a terminal and `cd` to the folder in which `docker-compose.yml` is saved and run:

```
cd full-stack-proxy-nginx-rancher-for-everyone-with-docker-compose
```

Copy the example environment into `.env`

```
cp env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to change values of ```LOCAL_TIMEZONE```, ```DOMAIN_NAME```, ```DIRECTORY_PATH``` and ```LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL```.

LOCAL_TIMEZONE=[to see local timezones](https://docs.diladele.com/docker/timezones.html)

DIRECTORY_PATH=```pwd``` at command line

### Installation

Firstly: will create external volume

```
docker volume create --driver local --opt type=none --opt device=${DIRECTORY_PATH}/certbot --opt o=bind certbot-etc
```

```
docker compose up -d
```

then reloading for proxy ssl configuration

```
docker container restart proxy
```

The containers are now built and running. You should be able to access the rancher installation with the configured IP in the browser address. `https://example.com`.

For convenience you may add a new entry into your hosts file.

## Usage

#### You could manage docker containers without command line with portainer.

### Show both running and stopped containers

The docker ps command only shows running containers by default. To see all containers, use the -a (or --all) flag:

```
docker ps -a
```

### Starting containers

You can start the containers with the `up` command in daemon mode (by adding `-d` as an argument) or by using the `start` command:

```
docker compose start
```

### Stopping containers

```
docker compose stop
```

### Removing containers

To stop and remove all the containers use the `down` command:

```
docker compose down
```

to remove portainer and the other containers
```
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
```

Use `-v` if you need to remove the database volume which is used to persist the database:

```
docker compose down -v
```

to remove external certbot-etc and portainer and the other volumes

```
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```

to remove portainer and the other images
```
docker rmi $(docker image ls -q)
```

### Project from existing source

Copy all files into a new directory:

You can now use the `up` command:

```
docker compose up -d
```

#### Proxy

Proxying is typically used to distribute the load among several servers, seamlessly show content from different websites, or pass requests for processing to application servers over protocols other than HTTP.

add or remove code in the ```./proxy/templates/proxy.conf.template``` file for custom proxy configurations
